In c we are using the "printf()" keyword for printing the statemets.
Ex: printf("Statement");
Here we are "%d" for printing the integers value.
Same way "%c" for printing the Characters value.
for printing the floating values we are using the "%f".
"%s" this is usefull for printing the string value or statements
Ex: printf("%d",variablename);// this is usefull for printing the integers values
printf("%f",variablename);// this for printing the the floating values
printf("%c",variablename);// this for printing thr charcter values
printf("%s",variablename);// this is for using printing the string values

"\n" plays an crucial role for printing the output line by line.

EX:printf("%d\n",variablename);// we can get the output line by line if use this method
