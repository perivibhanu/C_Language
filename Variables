Data Types are classifed into 3 types based on their operation.There arePrimary,Dervied and user defined data tpyes rescpectively.
Primary Data types are
   1.int: Stores integers values
         Ex:int a=1 
            int b=-5. 
     Typically occupies 2 or 4 bytes.

  2.float: Stores single-precision floating-point numbers 
         Ex:float a=3.14
           float b=3.0
    Occupies 4 bytes.

   3.double:Stores double-precision floating-point numbers
        EX: double a=3.14159
        double b=4.5646
    Occupies 8 bytes.

   4.char: Stores a single character 
       EX: char ch='A'
           char bv='a'
     Occupies 1 byte.

Derived Data Types


    1.Array: Collection of elements of the same type (e.g., int arr[5]).
    2.Pointer: Stores the address of another variable (e.g., int *ptr).
    3.Structure: Groups variables of different types (e.g., struct).
    4.Union: Similar to structures but shares memory among members.


>>Enumeration (enum):
Used to define a set of named integer constants (e.g., enum Color {RED, GREEN, BLUE};).

>>Void:
Represents "no type." Commonly used for functions that do not return a value (e.g., void function()).
  
>>Modifiers:
Modifiers adjust the size or range of basic data types:
short, long: Alters the size of integers (e.g., short int, long int).
signed, unsigned: Determines whether a variable can hold negative values (e.g., unsigned int).

EXAMPLE:

#include<stdio.h>
  int main(){
    int a=3;
    float b=3.6;
    char c='C';
    double pi=3.1478;
    return 0;
  }
